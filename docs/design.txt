Problem statement:
  Currently at the Eau Claire Figure Skating Club, ice time contracting is done via pencil and paper and snail mail. The goal is to
  have this done on the computer. The program will be able to input all of the skaters info: their name, parents email address, phone number,
  USFSA (United States Figure Skating Association) member number, their coaches name and email address. They would then pick what type of member
  they are. There are two types of members. A "regular" ECFSC member pays $11.50 per freestyle session, and $6.50 per moves session.
  An Alumni & Collegiate/Summer Associate Member pays $13.00 per freestyle session, and $7.00 per moves session. Once the skater has entered
  their information, and selected what type of member they are, they will be brought to the available ice times. They will select the
  ice times they wish to contract for, and once they press submit, it will output them their total number of sessions contracted for
  and how much they owe.
